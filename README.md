# üí¨ Decentralized P2P Messenger (Blockchain)

A secure peer-to-peer chat application designed to eliminate reliance on centralized servers. This project uses blockchain technology as a decentralized public key directory, enabling trustless and encrypted communication between users.

## üîê Key Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Messaging:** Connect and communicate directly between users.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Messages are encrypted using asymmetric cryptography (public/private key pairs).
- **Blockchain-Based Identity Verification:** Public keys are stored and verified using blockchain, removing the need for a centralized identity service.
- **No Central Server:** Entirely decentralized architecture ensures privacy and censorship resistance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend (if needed):** Node.js or Python for signaling (temporary)
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum or any EVM-compatible chain (for public key directory)
- **Communication Protocol:** WebRTC or TCP/UDP sockets
- **Encryption:** RSA / ECC for key pair generation and message encryption
